This is my neovim config.

If you want to use this, make sure to have this folder in
```/home/usr/.config/nvim```
You will need to change the name of this repo if you download it directly.

This uses packer as the package manager, which has since been depreciate, but still works.

The packages I have are:
- fugitive, a Git wrapper
- harpoon, a quick switch between files
- telescope, a fuzzy finder
- treesitter, a language parser
- undotree, an undo tree
